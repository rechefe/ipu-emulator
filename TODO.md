# IPU TODOs

- Add debug CLI option
- Implement multiple condition instructions (with prioritizing) - currently irrelevant 
- Write basic kernel for softmax - pseudocode
- Write basic kernel for CNN
- Implement quantization
- Add preprocessing CLI options (overriding parameters inside the `asm`)
- Add "Metadata" to registers and XMEM
- Add support for "union" like instruction in the assembler, specifically for LR instruction (immediate and LCR can be shared)
